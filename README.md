#Contact applicaton

##Full Stack Web Application.
This project is showing the process of developing a Full Stack Web Application that uses the MVC architecture. It showcases a Contact üëÅ View web app where users can save, view, update and delete contacts that they enter in.

###Front End
React JavaScript web application communicates with the Back End by performing all the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete). This app is the View component in the MVC model.

###Front End details. 

###Back End
The Back End consists of a few moving parts:

###Java Spring based application is the Controller component of the MVC model it accepts all HTTP requests from the View component and converts them to commands for the Model, then sends data back to the View for it to display.

###MySQL database servers as one of the  Model component's of the MVC architecture by providing a dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface.

###Back End details.
