#Contact applicaton

##Full Stack Web Application.
Full stack web application showing MVC (Model, View, Controller) It showcases a Contact üëÅ View web app where users can save, view, update and delete contacts that they enter in.

###Front End
React JavaScript web application will communicate with the Back End application performing full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete). This app(React) is the View component in the MVC model.

###Back End
The Back End contains a few more moving parts:

### Spring Boot (java)  based application is the Controller component of the MVC model it accepts all HTTP requests from the View component and converts them to commands for the Model, then sends data back to the View for it to display.

###MySQL database servers as one of the  Model component's of the MVC architecture by providing a dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface.

###Improvements to be made: 
I plan on designing a better layout for the application. 
I would like to implement an 3rd party Api
I want to also join this with my first idea for a Full Stack app. EduTracker for parents(child)
